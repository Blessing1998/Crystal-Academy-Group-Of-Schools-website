    <p>THE BUSINESS IDEA</p><p>
    
    Zimbabwe has fairly large mumber of school going children who are at the moment
    facing difficulties in finding good schools which offer excellent educational service 
    at affordable fees.During the hyperinflation and covid era,many schools were affected by
    teacher strikes and this led to poor provision of educational services.This caused an
    uproar and exorbitant fees which were charged placing parents on the harder side of the rock.
    Many private schools sprouted and most of them was run by unqualified teachers.There was an outcry by parents 
    which fell on deaf ears as the gorvenment could not meet all the educational  demands of most parents due to the 
    unstabilized economy.lt is a well known fact that the most vulnerable children are those in high density 
    locations such as Hobhouse.This scenario prompted lsaiah Musara together with his wife Thelma Musara
    to come up with Crystal Academy Group Of Schools in an attempt to meet the educational 
    demands of their community and country at large.
